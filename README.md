# Mukuru

3rd Party Libraries used:
- ORMlite:
 I used this for persistence to the SQLite database.
 I find using it for small scale app to be much easier to manage with the POJOs to define what
 tables I want and what I want in them. Queries can also be very fast to write and run

- Volley:
 I use Volley for my HTTP requests and I find it much easier to set it up and use it to make an API
 call for JSON that creating my own HTTP Client.

I converted all strings to French as a second language. I do not actually know French so I hope the
text is all correct.
